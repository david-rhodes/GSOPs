## Upgrade Guide for Existing Users
**Our licensing options have changed.** [Learn more](https://www.cgnomads.com/licensing).

As a part of our transition to [CG Nomads](http://www.cgnomads.com), we have removed the renderer submodule dependency and decoupled example data from the repository to reduce its size, improve maintainability, and streamline installation. Therefore, we recommend you perform a fresh clone and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) as normal.

## Where Magic Meets Reality
Add ✨ to your Gaussian splatting scenes with GSOPs — the most versatile Gaussian Splats editing toolset!

Gaussian splatting is a radiance field technology that turns photos and videos into high-quality 3D content with view-dependent effects and fast rendering. Gaussian Splatting Operators (GSOPs) is a plug-in for SideFX Houdini that grants artists total creative control over Gaussian splatting scenes.

GSOPs includes a real-time viewport renderer, [example files](https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs/tree/develop/hip), and a suite of digital assets for efficient import, editing, and export of 2D and 3D Gaussian splatting content.

Among its many capabilities, GSOPs is effective at isolating objects, eliminating noise and "floaters", deforming and animating splat models, composing scenes, meshing and relighting, performing feature analysis, and generating synthetic training data capable of delivering high-fidelity results with complex view-dependent effects.

Developed by [David Rhodes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidarhodes/) and [Ruben Diaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubendz/), GSOPs is now hosted under [CG Nomads](http://www.cgnomads.com).

Check out GSOPs on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=gsops) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh6-L_XjgKCv7PwEivhQJqEOCfqiY6pKg) for more examples.

🥉 GSOPs won 3rd place in the [H20 SIDEFX LABS Tech Art Challenge](https://www.sidefx.com/community-main-menu/contests-jams/h20-tech-art-challenge/).

## Motivation
Houdini's powerful, data-efficient architecture makes it the go-to platform for procedural content production across many industries. Its flexible and extensible design empowers users to tackle complex challenges at the right level of abstraction, focusing on problem-solving rather than low-level technicalities.

This unique combination of flexibility and ease of use is especially valuable in the rapidly evolving field of Novel View Synthesis. It enables quick prototyping, testing, and refinement of new workflows, keeping pace with the latest research. Additionally, it provides a direct path for innovations to transition into real-world applications within a well-established, production-ready solution.

SideFX, the developer of Houdini, fosters innovation through its "Labs" initiative. This incubator allows for the iteration of new tools and workflows before they become mainstream. Similarly, GSOPs provides a dedicated playground for Novel View Synthesis, enabling users to craft new workflows that closely align with the final visual result while prioritizing a creative and enjoyable process.

## Support Us
We're passionate about the potential of editable radiance fields in SideFX Houdini and we're eager to continue pushing boundaries. If you believe in this initiative or have benefitted from GSOPs, please consider donating.

## Installation
Clone this repository (use the `develop` branch for the latest and greatest).
* **[Using Git CLI]** `git clone https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs`
* **[Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)]** Clone repository with URL: `https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs.git`
### Automatic
1. Install and configure the GSOPs Houdini package by opening the `hip/gsops_installer.hip` file in Houdini, selecting the `INSTALL_GSOPS` node and clicking `INSTALL`.
   
    <img width="548" alt="419229706-0c526dae-0ed9-4ab0-b986-9924f29c1481" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0a08d0a-f6ea-491b-9419-a2e9e0fc706b" />
2. The installer will ask if you want to download sample data. Select "Yes" if you're interested in exploring our example content (recommended).
### Manual
1. Copy the `packages` directory from the cloned repo location to your Houdini user preferences directory. 
2. For each version of Houdini you want to use with GSOPs, change the "GSOPS" environment variable in the `.json` to your GSOPs clone location (e.g., `GSOPs_20.5.json` or `GSOPs_21.0.json`). 
3. [Optional] Change the `GSOPS_USER_DATA_DIR` value as you see fit. This is where GSOPS configuration data will be stored--it needs to be a writeable location!
4. [Optional] Download sample data using the GSOPs shelf button.

### Early Access Supporters
Activate your license using the GSOPs shelf button.

## Getting Started
1. If you chose not to download sample data during installation, you should do that now via the GSOPs Shelf. 
2. Open a few example scenes from the `hip` directory. Use these to validate your installation and better understand Gaussian splatting workflows.
3. For accurate color results, [disable OpenColorIO in the viewport](https://vimeo.com/1001396463). 
4. Disable viewport lighting and enable smooth shading. The `Gaussian Splats Source` node has a "Set Viewport Settings" button for your convenience. If you use this, set gamma in the color correction toolbar to 1.0. This button will also set the viewport renderer to use `OpenGL`, rather than `Vulkan` (required for live viewport compositing, see Edit->Preferences->3D Viewports->Renderer).

## GSOPs Nodes
<img src="/help/images/gsops_nodes.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

GSOPs is packed with features. For more information regarding any of the nodes shown above, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs/wiki/GSOPs-Nodes) and reference the built-in help cards.

## [NEW] Houdini 21 Native Gaussian Splatting Interoperability
Houdini 21 has native Gaussian Splatting, but SideFX uses different attribute data conventions. Use the `Gaussian Splats Convert` SOP to convert between GSOPs and Houdini's native conventions. 

## [EARLY ACCESS] Support for Compressed Splats
In addition to `.ply`, import `.splat` and `.spz` file formats.

## [EARLY ACCESS] Configurable Viewport Renderer
Unlock "live compositing" (traditional geometry and splats with proper depth sorting), "depth" and "worldPos" render modes.

## [EARLY ACCESS] Gaussian Splats Histogram
Plot and edit splats in histogram space based on any floating point attribute. This provides a fun and intuitive way to apply targeted edits to your scene.

## [EARLY ACCESS] Gaussian Splats Enhance
Add feature attributes to your splats, generate and/or improve normals, and add ambient occlusion and roughness approximations. These attributes can now be used by the `Gaussian Splats Relight IBL` node. 

## [EARLY ACCESS] Gaussian Splats Sharpen
Sharpen splats using optional mask attribute (e.g., from feature attributes).

## [EARLY ACCESS] Support for Solaris & Karma
We now provide a `Gaussian Splats Import` LOP node to simplify rendering and relighting Splats in Solaris. Additionally, the `Gaussian Splats Evaluate Spherical Harmonics` has been updated to bake spherical harmonics to the color attribute (`v@Cd`) for raytracing. Check out the `solaris.hip` example to learn more.

## [EARLY ACCESS] Gaussian Splats Mirror
Mirror your splats while preserving proper view dependent effects (spherical harmonics).

## Support for 2DGS
The `Gaussian Splats Import` SOP now accepts [2DGS](https://github.com/hbb1/2d-gaussian-splatting) models!

## Coarse Meshing
GSOPs 2.5 introduced dependency-free coarse meshing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. Coarse meshes are an effective "sparse node graph" for splat editing operations.

* [Coarse Meshing Utilities](https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs/wiki/GSOPs-Nodes#coarse-meshing)
* [Coarse Meshing Guidelines](https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs/wiki/Coarse-Meshing-Guidelines)

## Splat Animation Sequences
* It's possible to create, import, edit, and export splat animation sequences (one .ply per file). You can load and render these in [Postshot](https://www.jawset.com/), [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor/), [Brush](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush), and [Unity](https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs/blob/develop/extra/unity/UnityGaussianSplatting/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Synthetic Training Data
* You can use Houdini renders from procedural and manually generated camera poses (in COLMAP format) to convert your CG scenes to 3D Gaussian Splats. The `generate_training_data` SOP supports PNG image output, which enables the trainining of alpha-masked 3DGS models, which produces cleaner reconstructions.
* The `gaussian_splats_generate_training_data` SOP was updated in GSOPs 2.5 to support rendering in Karma and other 3rd party renderers. Previously, the render camera was constrained via Python, which caused evaluation issues in other Houdini contexts. The render camera is now constrained via channel expressions, avoiding this race condition. 

## Help
* Most digital assets exist in the SOPS context and (most) have their own help card documentation.
